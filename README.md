﻿# StealthOps

StealthOps is a top-down stealth-action game that I built in the Godot game engine as a way to learn the Godot engine. It was based on the course here with some game-play tweaks, optimizations, and new levels:  [https://www.udemy.com/course/godot/](https://www.udemy.com/course/godot/)

It is available on the Android Google Play store, you can read more about it here: [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.CyberSentient.StealthOps&hl=en_US](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.CyberSentient.StealthOps&hl=en_US)

You can test the game by downloading and installing Godot 3.1: [https://godotengine.org/download/windows](https://godotengine.org/download/windows)
Git clone this repo and open the project in Godot 3.1
